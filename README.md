# Installation
Just clone the contents of this repository **directly into** your AddOns folder and everything should appear just fine. Note that this repoistory makes heavy use of git submodules, as such, you must include the `--recurse-submodules` flag with your `git clone` operation.
```sh
$ cd <AddOns_directory_location>
$ git clone https://github.com/deadmeu/wow-vanilla-addons.git .
```
